### 📌 Background  

Inventory management is a core function of supply chain operations, ensuring the right products are available at the right time and place, without overstocking or understocking. Poor inventory control can lead to lost sales, high holding costs, or disrupted supply chain flow. This project was built around a real-world dataset to explore and analyze essential aspects such as stock levels, supplier lead times, restocking frequency, warehouse utilization, and product movement across geographies.

By translating raw inventory data into meaningful visual insights, this project aims to support smarter planning, reduce inefficiencies, and drive operational excellence in inventory systems.

### 🎯 Objective  

The objective of this project is to build an insightful Power BI dashboard that helps decision-makers:  
✔️ Monitor current stock levels and identify products below reorder thresholds  
✔️ Evaluate supplier performance based on lead times and restocking trends  
✔️ Detect seasonal patterns in restocking activity  
✔️ Analyze cost drivers and product pricing  
✔️ Understand warehouse utilization and geographic stock distribution  

The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and actionable, making it a practical tool for both operational teams and strategic planners.
